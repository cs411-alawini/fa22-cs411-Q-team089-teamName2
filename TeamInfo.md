## Project Summary

InCheck is a web application that helps with creating checklists with the additional feature of making shared checklists where other people can keep you in check. There can be other users who can help you keep track of your progress and you can also view and copy other peopleâ€™s tasks. One feature that we build upon this is sending reminders to people if they have not finished their tasks by their designated time.

There will be one table with all the users stored with attributes such as username, password, checklists, task completion rate, and other profile related information like gender, interests, etc. We will have a task table where you have attributes like the taskId, users, deadline (timestamp), creation time, duration, other users (friends)  looking over the task.
